# xtapx
xtapx is an applied research lab based in Red Deer, Alberta, advancing NFC technologies to enable secure, context-aware interactions between physical objects and digital systems. We develop prototypes addressing trust in asset provenance, ambient intelligence, and beyond, balancing user-centric design with robust security.

## Mission
Exploring NFC for reliable, intent-based connections, using physical proximity as a natural safeguard to challenge the frictionless-vs-secure tradeoff.

## Research Areas
- **Provenance and Ownership**: Tamper-resistant NFC for immutable asset histories, combating counterfeiting.
- **Ambient Intelligence**: Consent-first adaptive environments with AI-driven personalization in shared spaces.
- **Secure Interfaces**: Proximity-based access and intent triggers for low-friction, resilient systems.
- **Sustainability and Extensions**: NFC in eco-tracking, supply chain transparency, and interactive experiences.

We prioritize ethical, behavior-informed deployments. Explore our repos for prototypes and insights.
