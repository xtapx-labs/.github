# xtapx

xtapx is an applied research lab advancing NFC technologies to create secure, context-aware interactions at the physical-digital interface, developing prototypes that address trust challenges in asset provenance, environmental intelligence systems, and beyond.

Based in Red Deer, Alberta, we conduct hands-on experiments to resolve tensions between user-centric design and robust security, critiquing conventional approaches and engineering solutions that scale from individual assets to shared spaces.

### 🔭 Mission: Navigating the Physical-Digital Trust Frontier

xtapx explores how NFC can enable reliable, intent-based connections between objects and users, emphasizing applied innovations that mitigate vulnerabilities while enhancing usability. We challenge the assumption that frictionless experiences inherently compromise security, instead designing systems where physical presence serves as a natural safeguard.

Our research agenda:
- **Provenance and Ownership**: Developing tamper-resistant digital histories for high-value items, using dynamic NFC signatures to create immutable chains of custody and combat counterfeiting in resale markets.
- **Environmental Intelligence Systems**: Designing consent-first adaptive environments that respond back to feedback inputs, with ML-driven soundscapes balancing personal and group preferences in shared spaces.
- **UX-Security Paradox**: Analyzing trade-offs between intuitive interactions and robust defenses, including social engineering risks at physical-digital boundaries, to inform resilient system architectures.
- **Contextual Access and Intent Interfaces**: Exploring NFC for proximity-based permissions and event-triggered engagements, ensuring secure, low-friction flows without invasive monitoring.
- **Sustainability and Extension**: Investigating NFC applications in eco-tracking and interactive merchandising, extending core principles to broader domains like supply chain transparency and gamified user experiences.

prioritizing ethical deployment, drawing from behavioral insights to ensure technologies respect human heuristics without exploitation.
