# xtapx

**xtapx** is an applied research lab advancing NFC technologies to create secure, context-aware interactions at the physical-digital interface, developing prototypes that address trust challenges in asset provenance, environmental intelligence systems, and beyond.

Based in Red Deer, Alberta, we conduct hands-on experiments to resolve tensions between user-centric design and robust security, critiquing conventional approaches and engineering solutions that scale from individual assets to shared spaces.

## Mission: Navigating the Physical-Digital Trust Frontier

We explore how NFC enables reliable, intent-based connections between objects and users, challenging the assumption that frictionless experiences inherently compromise security. Instead, we design systems where physical presence serves as a natural safeguard.

## Our Research Agenda

**Provenance and Ownership:** Developing tamper-resistant digital histories for high-value items using dynamic NFC signatures to create immutable chains of custody and combat counterfeiting in resale markets.

**Environmental Intelligence Systems:** Consent-first adaptive environments that respond to feedback inputs, with ML-driven soundscapes balancing personal and group preferences in shared spaces.

**UX-Security Paradox:** Analyzing trade-offs between intuitive interactions and robust defenses, including social engineering risks, to inform resilient architectures.

**Contextual Access and Intent Interfaces:** Exploring proximity-based permissions and event-triggered engagements for secure, low-friction flows without invasive monitoring.

**Sustainability and Extension:** Investigating NFC applications in eco-tracking, interactive merchandising, supply chain transparency, and gamified experiences.

All work prioritizes ethical deployment, drawing from behavioral insights to respect human heuristics without exploitation.
